            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hey, I'm Arbab Zafar, a 14-year-old student at Creane Memorial High School, rocking it in Class 9 A. Let
                me tell you a bit about myself!</p>

        <div class="main" id="aboutMe">
            <h1>The Coding Bug</h1>
            <p>My journey with coding started back in Class 6. It all began with Python - those first few lines of code
                opened up a whole new world for me. Fast forward to Class 8, and I met HTML. As my coding journey
                progressed, I ventured into the realms of CSS and JavaScript. That's when things got seriously
                interesting.</p>

        <div class="main" id="aboutMe">
            <h1>Falling in Love with Websites</h1>
            <p>HTML was like magic. I could create stuff on the internet! I started making websites, from simple ones to
                web games and useful apps. The joy of seeing my code come to life was just incredible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="main" id="aboutMe">
            <h1>A Bit of Everything</h1>
            <p>I'm not just about coding. I take my studies seriously and manage to ace them too. Beyond the books,
                you'll find me exploring NodeJS, React, and a bunch of other cool things.</p>

        <div class="main" id="aboutMe">
            <h1>What I've Been Up To</h1>
            <p>I've made this space, my portfolio website, to show you what I've been cooking up. From games to handy
                apps, it's all here. I'm on a journey of learning and creating, and I'd love for you to tag along.</p>
